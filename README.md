## how it works
- The APP reads your Gyroscope and And based on some Poor if-else Condition it Updates the key **z** in the databse
- The Python app here reads the same and Uses PyAutoGUI to move the Mouse 
- Coolest Thing here is You can Modify the Line number 11 to control your device Mouse anywhere in the world where there is good internet connection

## What Next ?
- Make a One faster 
- I actually thought of making one which transmits data Over Bluetooth But my poor PC dosen't has One. So, Make one with Bluetooth
